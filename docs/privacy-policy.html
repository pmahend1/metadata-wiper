            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 19, 2025</p>

            <p>Thank you for using Metadata Wiper (the "App"). This privacy policy outlines how data is handled within
                the application. Your privacy is our top priority.</p>

            <h2>1. Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
            <p>Metadata Wiper is designed to be a private and secure utility. We <strong>do not</strong> collect, store,
                share, or transmit any personal information or data from you or your device.</p>

            <p>This includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> We do not ask for or collect any personal information such as
                    your name, email address, location, or contacts.</li>
                <li><strong>Usage Analytics:</strong> The App does not contain any third-party analytics or tracking
                    tools. We do not monitor how you use the app.</li>
                <li><strong>Image or File Data:</strong> Your images and their metadata are processed locally on your
                    device and are never sent to any external server.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. How the App Works</h2>
            <p>The function of Metadata Wiper is to remove EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format) metadata from images
                you select. The process is entirely offline:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>File Selection:</strong> The App uses the standard Android Storage Access Framework for you
                    to select an image from your device's local storage. The App only gains temporary, user-consented
                    access to the specific file you choose.</li>
                <li><strong>Local Processing:</strong> All metadata reading and removal happens entirely and exclusively
                    on your device.</li>
                <li><strong>Saving the Cleaned File:</strong> After processing, the App prompts you to choose a new
                    location on your device to save the "cleaned" image. You have full control over where this file is
                    saved.</li>
                <li><strong>No Original File Modification:</strong> The App does not alter your original image file. It
                    creates a new, separate copy with the metadata removed, leaving your original file untouched.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>3. Permissions Required</h2>
            <p>The Metadata Wiper application uses modern Android practices that minimize the need for permissions.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The app <strong>does not require</strong> broad <code>READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code> or
                    <code>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code> permissions. It uses the system file picker, which grants
                    temporary access to files selected by the user.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Third-Party Libraries</h2>
            <p>The App uses the following open-source libraries, which have been reviewed to ensure they align with our
                privacy standards:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>AndroidX Libraries (Jetpack):</strong> Used for core application functionality
                    (<code>androidx.core.ktx</code>, <code>androidx.lifecycle.runtime.ktx</code>,
                    <code>androidx.activity.compose</code>, <code>androidx.material3</code>).</li>
                <li><strong>Jetpack Compose:</strong> Used for building the app's user interface.</li>
                <li><strong>Coil (coil-compose):</strong> Used for efficiently loading and displaying the image you
                    select <em>locally</em> on your device's screen.</li>
                <li><strong>ExifInterface (androidx.exifinterface):</strong> Used for reading and removing the EXIF
                    metadata from the image file on your device.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>None of these libraries are used to collect or transmit personal user data from the App.</p>

            <h3>5. Children's Privacy</h3>
            <p>This App does not collect any personal information, making it safe for all users, including children. We
                do not knowingly collect any data from children under the age of 13.</p>

            <h3>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new
                Privacy Policy on the app's store listing. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically
                for any changes.</p>
